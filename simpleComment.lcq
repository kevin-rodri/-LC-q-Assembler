; This is just a simple program with a few comments
; First print out the value 1
LDI R0 1
PRINT R0
; Now double it by adding to itself (should print 2)
ADD R0 R0 R0
PRINT R0
; And double again (should print 4)
ADD R0 R0 R0
PRINT R0
; And let us square it too (should print 16 now)
MULT R0 R0 R0
PRINT R0
; That is it...
